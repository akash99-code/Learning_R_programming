# This is my First Program

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = 'C:/Users/ashok/Desktop/MscDsII/6.Software lab in R/idea/')
```

Default values are put as part of the below code

`{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
`


```{r  include=FALSE,echo=FALSE}

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

### Small Demo on what all is possible with R Markdown
- Bullet points
- *italics*
- **bold**
- `code - Your code will be highlighted like this`
- [RMarkdown Home](rmarkdown.rstudio.com)
- [RMarkdown Useful resource](https://holtzy.github.io/Pimp-my-rmd/)
- Albert Einstein's Theory of relativity Eqation $E = MC^{2}$

```{r cars}
cars
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.height=3,fig.width=4}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
