######### R tidyverse

#Pre-requisites
There are four things you need to run the code in this book:
R, RStudio, a collection of R packages called the tidyverse, and a handful of other packages.

# Install tidyverse
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Load tidyverse
Once you have installed a package, you can load it with the library() function:
library(tidyverse)

####### Packages Loaded
This tells you that tidyverse is loading the 
ggplot2,
tibble,
tidyr,
readr,
purrr,
and dplyr packages. 
These are considered to be the core of the tidyverse because you’ll use them in almost every analysis

### Upadting tidyverse
Packages in the tidyverse change fairly frequently.
You can see if updates are available, and optionally install them, by running tidyverse_update().

### Packages - Datasets used in tidyverse
install.packages(c("nycflights13", "gapminder", "Lahman"))
These packages provide data on airline flights, world development,
and baseball that we’ll use to illustrate key data science ideas.

########
The easiest way to include data in a question is to use dput() to generate the R code to recreate it.
